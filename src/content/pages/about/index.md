### I'm Jerod.
I build things for the web, mostly with JavaScript. I also write blog posts, case studies, and white papers for startups and SaaS companies.

I got into programming as a hobby while in college and have been hacking away in some capacity ever since.

### I love JavaScript.
Honestly. JS is everywhere and has the most interesting, active ecosystem on the planet. It was the first language I learned, is ideal for functional composition (big fan), and can increasingly be used to build just about anything.

Also, JS people are awesome.

### Python's great, too.
The first backend framework I learned was Django and getting into Python is still one of the best things I've ever done. Again, great community, all-purpose features, friendly to functional programming, and if you want to do some machine learning or build a web scraper, there's nothing better.

### Currenty:
Right now, I'm looking for my next project. My preferred stack is for big apps is React/Redux and Express, though static frameworks like Gatsby.js are really coming on and proving their mettle as alternatives to traditional fullstack development. Look no further than this site for proof that (built in a fervor with Gatsby).
