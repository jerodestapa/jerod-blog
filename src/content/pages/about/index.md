### I'm Jerod.
I'm a full-stack web developer, technical writer, and data analyst.

I got into programming as a hobby while in college and have been hacking away in some capacity ever since.

### Tooling
My weapons of choice are Python and JavaScript, but I'm always looking to learn something new. 

### When not programming?
Away from work, I love to cook and hang out with my wife and three daughters, who tolerate my love of sci-fi and soccer with patience and understanding.
