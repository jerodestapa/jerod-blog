Hello! Welcome, and as I said before, it's too late. You're here, I am now in your headspace, and there's no escape.

Just kidding.

It's really not that bad, and honestly, feel free to leave whenever you want. But, feel free to stay, too. Basically, just do whatever you want.

So, right. Me. Well, I'm an longstanding autodidact, which as you may know, means I worship shellfish and don't believe in communicable diseases.

That's actually very wrong. What it really means is I'm ... self-taught.

I know. I can barely live with myself.
