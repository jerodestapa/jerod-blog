If you've ever contributed to an open source project, you're eventually going to be asked to do something with [git](https://git-scm.com/) that you may not know how to do. You may not even know what they're talking about.

The conversation might go something like this:

```
Hey, great PR! Thanks! Can you rebase so we can merge this in?
```


To which, you reply:

```
Sure, no problem!
```


Meanwhile, you're dying inside. *Rebase? What the hell is a rebase and how do I not know that and I'm an imposter and why am I doing this I'm a fake!!*
