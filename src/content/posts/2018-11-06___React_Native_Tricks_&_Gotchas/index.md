React Native is my favorite ecosystem for building mobile apps. It's fast, there's *almost* no context switching between iOS and Android, and I can get very far in a project before having to worry about writing any Swift or Kotlin.

Hell, depending on the app, you may spend 100% of your time writing JavaScript, which might sound like hell to some developers. But not this one.
